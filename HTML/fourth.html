<p style="color: blue;">C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features.By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>

<h2 align="center"><u><b>Java</b></u></h2>
<p style="color: blue;">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16</p>
